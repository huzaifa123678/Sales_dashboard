
# Sales Dashboard

This is an interactive **Sales Dashboard** built with **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
It uses a cleaned sales dataset (`cleaned_sales_data.csv`) and provides insights into sales performance.

## Features
- ✅ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales & Average Order Value  
- ✅ Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)  
- ✅ Distribution of Order Status (Pie Chart)  
- ✅ Interactive Filters for exploring data
